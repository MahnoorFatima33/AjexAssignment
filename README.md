#Weather Application
This simple weather application allows users to fetch weather data for a specific city using AJAX and display it on the webpage dynamically.

#How to Run Locally
To run the application locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-application.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd weather-application

Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

Enter the name of the city for which you want to fetch weather information in the input field provided.

Click the "Get Weather" button to trigger the AJAX request and fetch weather data for the specified city.

The weather information will be displayed dynamically on the webpage without reloading the page.

#API Key
Please note that the application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data. You need to sign up for an API key on the OpenWeatherMap website and replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' in the script.js file with your actual API key.
